# libft

This project is a personal implementation of standard C library functions, as part of the 42 school curriculum.

## Objectives

- Recreate basic functions from the C standard library
- Understand memory management, pointer logic, and string manipulation
- Create a reusable static library (`libft.a`)

## Features

- Standard functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `atoi`, `memcpy`, etc.
- Memory management: `calloc`, `bzero`, etc.
- Character checks: `isalpha`, `isdigit`, etc.
- Bonus: Linked list operations (`lstnew`, `lstadd_back`, etc.)

## Usage

```bash
make
